            # UGER specific flags
            
            ##
            # [optional] prepend the '-clear' arg to the native specification
            #     Equivalent to adding '-clear' as the first arg of the bsub command
            #     Default: false
            #
            #     This is a workaround for a known issue with Univa Grid Engine (circa 8.4.0)
            #     which causes custom queue requests (e.g. -q long) to be appended to the system wide
            #     default queue instead of replacing it. 
            #
            #     Note: another workaround is to create a ~/.sge_request file, as a copy of the system default
            #         cp $SGE_ROOT/$SGE_CELL/common/sge_request ~/.sge_request
            #     Add '-clear' as the first entry in that file, and customize as necessary. 
            #     For more details: man sge_request
